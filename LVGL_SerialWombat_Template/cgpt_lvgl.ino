/*
 create lvgl code for arduino for a 320x240 display that allows periodic display 
 of variables that change in the background. the uint16_t variable swFramesRun is displayed as text. 
 Two more uint16_t variables swPotentiometer and swPotentiometer2 are displayed as an updating chart. 
 A slider bar changes a third uint16_t variable swServo. 
 precede any variables or function names created with cgpt_ex_ to show that they came from this example. 
 Assume that code to set up the display driver, copy the buffer, and read the touchscreen already exists elsewhere. 
 The range for swServo is 0 to 65535 . Give the overall display a dark aesthetic .
